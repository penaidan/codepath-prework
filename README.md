## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
3 favorite apps: 
    - Clock:
        Simple 
        Always tells me what I need to know 
    - Notes:
        I can write as many reminders and lists as I want
        Organized
        Infinite
    - Google Maps: 
        Very useful
        Can show me how to get anywhere I want to go
        
App idea: 
    I would like to create an app that can truly wake up. 
    I am normally very grumpy when I ask people to wake me up from a nap and end up sleeping more than I should becuase no one can wake me up. I propose an app that continues emitting an alarm until you do something that requires a sharp mind such as a puzzle or typing some long sentence/paragraph. Another possibility is if the app can connect to some other device in the house that will also emit a noise until do the particular thing. 

## Notes

Challenges encountered: 
I found that the app didn't run properly the first time because I had tried to edit the IBAction name directly and tried deleting it once and then reuploading it. I wasn't sure how to fix this so I had to restart the project.
